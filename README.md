# Hierarchical-Clustering-Example
A simple example to apply hierarchical clustering on a given dataset.
In this python notebook, I tried to do model fitting with some visualization and some basic data recognization techniques application like info, head. At last I went through some visualization. It is done on an open source data, but I am attaching it here for everyone's comfort.
